# Pipeviz

Pipeviz is a system for visualizing what you need to know as a software-driven organization: your development workflow, the state of your infrastructure, and more. It's a database and visualization webapp rolled into one, fed with data by an ecosystem of agents and other message producers.

## Installation

To set up pipeviz for development purposes, see [the development guide](https://github.com/pipeviz/pipeviz/wiki/Getting%20started).

To set up a production instance of pipeviz...oh wait, don’t do that yet :) We’re very alpha!
